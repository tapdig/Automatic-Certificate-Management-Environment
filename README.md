# Automatic-Certificate-Management-Environment
# Project 1: ACME Client
## 1 | General Information
Implementation of ACME protocol (RFC8555) for Network Security 2023 course at ETH Zurich.

## 2 | ACME Protocol
Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) using X.509 certificates are used for many purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of domain names. Certificate Authorities (CAs) are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate. Traditionally, this verification is done through various ad-hoc methods.

The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol ([RFC8555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555)) aims to facilitate the automation of certificate issuance by creating a standardized and machine-friendly protocol for certificate management.

## 3 |  Your Task
Your task is to write an application that implements ACMEv2. However, to make the application self-contained and in order to facilitate testing, your application will need to have more functionality than a bare ACME client. The concrete requirements for your application are described in the remainder of this section.

### 3.1 | Application Components
Your submitted application must consist of the following components:
- *ACME client:* An ACME client which can interact with a standard-conforming ACME server.
- *DNS server:* A DNS server which resolves the DNS queries of the ACME server.
- *Challenge HTTP server:* An HTTP server to respond to http-01 queries of the ACME server.
- *Certificate HTTPS server:* An HTTPS server which uses a certificate obtained by the ACME client.
- *Shutdown HTTP server:*  An HTTP server to receive a shutdown signal.

### 3.2 |  Required Functionality 
In order to receive full marks, your application should be able to
- use ACME to request and obtain certificates using the `dns-01` and `http-01` challenge (with fresh keys in every run),
- request and obtain certificates which contain aliases,
- request and obtain certificates with wildcard domain names, and
- revoke certificates after they have been issued by the ACME server.

Note that the automatic tests enforce a timeout of 1 minute.
Furthermore, the final grading will be determined by a second offline run of the tests.
You are therefore advised to avoid nondeterministic behavior of your implementation, e.g., due to multi-threading.

### 3.3 | Input and Output
#### 3.3.1 | File layout
We will supply you with a basic skeleton which you should use for submission. Three files in this skeleton are of particular importance:
- `pebble.minica.pem`
This is the CA certificate for the private key used to sign the certificate of the HTTPS endpoint of the ACME server itself. Use this as a trust root to check the ACME server's certificate when interacting with this endpoint. You will lose points if your application sends more than one request to an ACME server with an invalid certificate (one request is needed to obtain the certificate and check its validity).
- `compile`
This file will be executed by the automated-testing environment before any tests are run. You should modify this file. If your project needs to be compiled, this file should contain the commands needed to compile the project. If no compilation is needed, this file can do nothing (or install dependencies). Note that you are only allowed to install explicitly allowed dependencies, see [below](#guidelines).
- `run`
This file will be executed by the testing environment when the tests are being run. You should modify this file. It will receive the command-line arguments listed in [Section 3.3.2](#arguments). Your `compile` script may overwrite this file.

Note that all paths in your code should be relative to the root of the repository.

#### 3.3.2 | Command-line arguments <a name="arguments"></a>
Your application should support the following command-line arguments (passed to the `run` file):

**Positional arguments:**
- `Challenge type`
_(required, `{dns01 | http01}`)_ indicates which ACME challenge type the client should perform. Valid options are `dns01` and `http01` for the `dns-01` and `http-01` challenges, respectively.

**Keyword arguments:**
- `--dir DIR_URL`
_(required)_ `DIR_URL` is the directory URL of the ACME server that should be used.
- `--record IPv4_ADDRESS` 
_(required)_ `IPv4_ADDRESS` is the IPv4 address which must be returned by your DNS server for all A-record queries. 
- `--domain DOMAIN`
_(required, multiple)_ `DOMAIN`  is the domain for  which to request the certificate. If multiple `--domain` flags are present, a single certificate for multiple domains should be requested. Wildcard domains have no special flag and are simply denoted by, e.g., `*.example.net`.
- `--revoke`
_(optional)_ If present, your application should immediately revoke the certificate after obtaining it. In both cases, your application should start its HTTPS server and set it up to use the newly obtained certificate.

**Example:**
Consider the following invocation of `run`:
```
run dns01 --dir https://example.com/dir --record 1.2.3.4 --domain netsec.ethz.ch --domain syssec.ethz.ch
```
When invoked like this, your application should obtain a single certificate valid for both `netsec.ethz.ch` and `syssec.ethz.ch`. It should use the ACME server at the URL `https://example.com/dir` and perform the `dns-01` challenge. The DNS server of the application should respond with `1.2.3.4` to all requests for `A` records. Once the certificate has been obtained, your application should start its certificate HTTPS server and install the obtained certificate in this server.

### 3.4 | Server sockets
Your application should be running the following services on the following ports:
- *DNS server:* should run on UDP port 10053. The ACME server will direct all of its DNS queries to this DNS server.
- *Challenge HTTP server:* should run on TCP port 5002. The ACME server will direct all `http-01` challenges to this port. Note that this deviates from RFC8555.
- *Certificate HTTPS server:* should run on TCP port 5001. The testing environment will issue a `GET /` request to this server in order to obtain the certificate served by this server. The server should serve the full certificate chain obtained from the ACME server, i.e., including the intermediate certificate.
- *Shutdown HTTP server:* should run on TCP port 5003. Once testing is complete, the testing environment will issue a `GET /shutdown` request to this server. When this request is received, your application should terminate itself.

## 4 | Testing
We recommend the use of [Pebble](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble) for local testing. Pebble is a lightweight ACME server designed specifically for testing. During the automated testing your application will be tested against a Pebble server.

Note that by default, Pebble is configured to reject 5% of good nonces. The grading environment, on the contrary, does not reject valid nonces. Hence, we do not expect your application to gracefully handle cases of unjustly rejected nonces. To achieve the same Pebble behavior locally as is used in the CI testing, adjust the value of the corresponding environment variable: `export PEBBLE_WFE_NONCEREJECT=0`.
